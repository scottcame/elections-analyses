### Election Analyses Project Repository

This repository contains various projects to support analyses of elections:

* alaska-precincts: A demonstration of using spatial polygon overlays to convert precinct-level election results (as published by the State of Alaska) into
county-equivalent level results (Alaska has boroughs and census areas...called "county equivalents"...instead of counties)
* australia-federal-2016: R scripts to process results from Australia's 2016 Federal election, along with 2016 census data, and upload a tidy version to [data.world](https://data.world/). Also
contains scripts and a notebook to analyze/visualize the results.
* olympia-schools-20180213: Munging and visualizing results of the Olympia (Washington) capital projects levy election in February 2018
